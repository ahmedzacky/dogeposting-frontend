## Social media app for dogs 🐶🐕‍🦺

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`
to install the packages used locally

### `npm start`

to run the app in the browser

I plan on making this site consumable to humans sometime later, I'll write about my vision later,

This is just a skeleton social media app for fun
